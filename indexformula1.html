    <p>
      There are undoubtedly a lot of great sports out there, but none of them -
      no even Football - can match the level of anxiety, thrill, excitment and
      passion of Formula 1
    </p>

    <p>
      I consider myself to be one of the biggest F1 fans alive and today I'm
      going to tell why do I think there is nothing quite like F1 on the globe
    </p>

    <h3>What is Formula 1?</h3>

    <p>
      Formula 1 is a racing series that takes place all arround the round the
      world between the months of February and December (2022 was an exception
      due to the FIFA World Cup also taking place in December). It's the highest
      level of racing you will find anywhere in the globe.
    </p>

    <p>
      Formula stands for the set of regulations that all the teams have to
      comply with in order to compete in the series, meanwhile the number 1 is
      meant to denote that it's the top category of all the Formulas in the
      world.
    </p>

    <p>F1 is made of two championships:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Drivers' Championship (for drivers)</li>
      <li>Constructors' Championship (for teams)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why should you watch F1?</h3>

    <p>
      There are countless reasons for you to start watching F1. The main ones in
      my opinions are the following:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Sick theme song that makes you excited for the race every single weekend
      </li>
      <li>Lot of content available online (Youtube, Netflix, F1TV and more)</li>
      <li>Teams strategies during the race</li>
      <li>Oportunity of getting immersed in the world of F1</li>
      <li>
        It's history (That's absolutely fantastic, with heroes and villains
        created throughout more than 70 years of racing).
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      For you to enjoy F1 like I do, you can't just stick with watching the
      races on Sundays, you'll need to fully immerse yourself on the teams
      backgrounds, strategies and operations throughout the whole week, apart
      from watching pre and post race shows to get a full insight on the
      weekend. I mean, you probably can enjoy F1 without doing all of this, but
      for me this is what makes this sport like no other, the amount of insights
      and exciment we can get when there's no racing activity actually happening
      on track.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the end of the day, I can guarantee that this is what will essentially
      make you watch a full race or season even if it's boring. You will be so
      invested in the enviroment of F1 that you'll not even care.
